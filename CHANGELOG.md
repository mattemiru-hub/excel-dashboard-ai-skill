# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill package will be tracked here.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `references/dashboard-blueprint-router-vi.md` to force blueprint selection on unfamiliar datasets
- `references/tooling-contract-vi.md` to tell other AIs exactly which Excel tools must be used and which shortcuts are forbidden
- `references/intake-form-vi.md` to standardize the pre-build intake questions on unfamiliar datasets

### Changed

- upgraded the skill from ambiguity-only clarification to mandatory intake on first build
- updated the prompt surface to require blueprint selection and Power Query + Data Model + DAX + PivotChart architecture
- updated the README files to explain the public-share discovery-first workflow
- expanded the tooling contract so other AIs know both the mandatory Excel stack and the required runtime capabilities
- added fail-safe wording so agents must ask first, summarize intake, and admit when they only produced guidance instead of a real Excel build
